$section CppAD Changes and Additions During 2014$$

$head Introduction$$
This section contains a list of the changes to CppAD during 2014
(in reverse order by date).
The purpose of this section is to
assist you in learning about changes between various versions of CppAD.

$head 02-28$$
The $cref/data/CppAD_vector/data/$$ function was added to the
$code CppAD::vector$$ template class.

$head 02-27$$
The CppAD developer documentation for the subdirectory
$code cppad/ipopt$$ was not being built by the command 
$code bin/run_doxygen.sh$$. 
This has been fixed.

$head 02-26$$
$list number$$
The 
$cref/adolc/speed_adolc/$$ and
$cref/cppad/speed_cppad/$$ sparse jacobian speed tests now print out
$cref/n_sweep/sparse_jacobian/n_sweep/$$.
$lnext
The size of some of the $cref speed$$ test cases has been increased
to test behavior for larger problems.
$lnext
A link to $cref ode_evaluate$$ was missing in the
$cref/Speed Utility Routines/speed_utility/Speed Utility Routines/$$ table.
This has been fixed.
$lend


$head 02-23$$
The $cref/color_method/sparse_jacobian/work/color_method/$$
option was added to the sparse Jacobian calculations.
This enables one to use $cref/ColPack/colpack_prefix/$$ 
do color the rows or columns.
The speed test $cref/colpack/speed_main/option_list/colpack/$$ option 
was also added (but not yet implemented for 
$cref/sparse_hessian/link_sparse_hessian/$$ speed tests).


$head 02-22$$
The program names in
$cref  thread_test.cpp$$ where changes from
$icode%threading%_test%$$ to $codei%multi_thread_%threading%$$
where $icode threading$$ is $code openmp$$, $code pthread$$ or $code bthread$$.

$head 02-17$$
Fix ambiguous call to $cref/isnan/nan/isnan/$$ 
during MS Visual Studio 2012 compilation.

$head 02-15$$
$list number$$
The $cref/boolsparsity/speed_main/option_list/boolsparsity/$$ option
was added to the $cref speed_main$$ program.
$lnext
The $code retape$$ option what changed to 
$cref/onetape/speed_main/option_list/onetape/$$ so that the default
is to retape (option not present).
This was done because 
$cref/fadbad/fadbad_prefix/$$ and
$cref/sacado/sacado_prefix/$$ always retape.
$lnext
The documentation, and example source code, for all the speed
$cref/options/speed_main/option_list/$$ was improved
(made clearer).
$lnext
Improve the success rate for 
$cref speed_test.cpp$$ and $cref time_test.cpp$$.
$lend

$head 01-26$$
The destination directory for the
$cref/cppad documentation/cmake/cmake_install_docdir/$$
is now set separately from the data directory
using the $code cmake$$ option
$codei%
	-D cmake_install_docdir=%cmake_install_docdir%
%$$
This has increased the flexibility of the documentation installation
and removed the need for the option
$codei%
	-D cppad_documentation=%yes_or_no%
%$$
which has been removed.
	
$head 01-21$$
The destination directory for the
cppad documentation
used to be one of the following:
$codei%
	%prefix%/%datadir%/doc/cppad-%version%
	%prefix%/%datadir%/doc/%postfix%cppad-%version%
%$$
This has been changed by dropping the $icode version$$ number
at the end of the directory name.

$head 01-10$$
The change on $cref/2013-12-27/whats_new_13/12-27/$$
caused a conversion error in $cref atan2$$ when it was used with
$code AD< AD<double> >$$ arguments (and other similar cases).
This has been fixed.
